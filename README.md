# DataGarden

Welcome to DataGarden Code and supplimentary materials. 

This code contains a website which displays the gallery and supplimentary materials.

PLEASE NOTE: The application has been developed in the Chrome webbrowser, and may not work on other browsers. It does not work on IPad (because IPad's have limited web standard support).

If you have NodeJS, this can be done via navigating to the main folder and running "npm install express" then "node app.js" and open http://localhost:3333
